Sander Vermolen has produced a VDM to HOL translator prototype together with HOL tactics that allow VDM proof obligations to be discharged in the theorem prover HOL.
Vermolen's VDM++ prototype is complete enough to discharge proof obligations arising from functional VDM++ models.
However the prototype's performance is very limited as it can only be executed within a VDM++ interpreter.
Through the VDM++ to Java code generator tool, provided by the VDMTools, the prototype was implemented in Java allowing for its integration in the Overture Automatic Proof System.

The Automatic Proof System is a Java program that promotes the interoperation between a VDM proof obligation generation tool, the VDM to HOL translator, and the theorem prover HOL.
The current paper reports on the challenges and achievements of the Automatic Proof System's implementation, as part of the Overture Tool framework.
