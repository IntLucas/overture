With the eyes of the world upon us, the anomaly team used each scrap of information, our knowledge of the system, and sheer determination to analyze and fix the problem, then return the vehicle to normal operation. This paper will discuss the Spirit FLASH anomaly, including the drama of the investigation, the root cause and the lessons learned from the experience.},

  abstract =   {This article provides a historical overview of a decade of the development of the IFAD VDM Toolboxes commonly referred to as VDMTools. All along, the existing tools have been used in the development of new major components. This kind of "bootstrapping " approach where a CASE tool is developed by taking ""its own medicine" is seldom used. However, we believe that this approach is important to be able to better understand what the most important improvements are for the users in practice. This article also describes how the different components have been maintained by a changing development team. We feel that the decisions we have made regarding the parts of the tool which have been formally specified and the parts which have been developed conventionally may provide valuable input for others considering the use of formal specification. The overall organisation of the development environment may also be interesting for other developers.

Completed in 1983, this work culminates nearly half a century of the late
Alfred Tarski's foundational studies in logic, mathematics, and the philosophy
of science. Written in collaboration with Steven Givant, the book appeals to a
very broad audience, and requires only a familiarity with first-order logic.
It is of great interest to logicians and mathematicians interested in the
foundations of mathematics, but also to philosophers interested in logic,
semantics, algebraic logic, or the methodology of the deductive sciences, and
to computer scientists interested in developing very simple computer languages
rich enough for mathematical and scientific applications.

The authors show that set theory and number theory can be developed within the
framework of a new, different, and simple equational formalism, closely
related to the formalism of the theory of relation algebras. There are no
variables, quantifiers, or sentential connectives. Predicates are constructed
from two atomic binary predicates (which denote the relations of identity and
set-theoretic membership) by repeated applications of four operators that are
analogues of the well-known operations of relative product, conversion,
Boolean addition, and complementation. All mathematical statements are
expressed as equations between predicates. There are ten logical axiom
schemata and just one rule of inference: the one of replacing equals by
equals, familiar from high school algebra.

Though such a simple formalism may appear limited in its powers of expression
and proof, this book proves quite the opposite. The authors show that it
provides a framework for the formalization of practically all known systems of
set theory, and hence for the development of all classical mathematics.

The book contains numerous applications of the main results to diverse areas
of foundational research: propositional logic; semantics; first-order logics
with finitely many variables; definability and axiomatizability questions in
set theory, Peano arithmetic, and real number theory; representation and
decision problems in the theory of relation algebras; and decision problems in
equational logic.
