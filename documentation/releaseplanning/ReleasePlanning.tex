\chapter{Introduction}

This document is intended to provide an overview of the release
planning for the open source project called Overture. Efforts will be
made to ensure that stable releases of the executables for
Overture in a systematic fashion. It is recommended that
official public releases of these executables are synchronised with
each other. The planning presented here is aggressive and probably on
the optimistic side but naturally this also depends upon the time the
different stakeholders are able to deliver to the projects during
2010.

Official major public releases will be made yearly and will be made
available through the Overture official websites.  One month before
the major release, a Release Candidate will be made for the purpose of
testing and locate bugs. In the meantime, snapshot builds will be
provided via SourceForge. In this period only bug fixes needed for the
features planning in that release will be checked in. Minor official
public releases will be released approximately once every three months
and for each of these two weeks of release candidate periods will be
used. A full release procedure will be followed for each of the public
releases such that the users can expect all public releases to be
stable.  In between these public releases ad-hoc releases will be
produced on a needs basis but it is suggested that at least a weekly
build that contains the latest source code will be put in system. For
such ad-hoc releases the documentation cannot be guaranteed to be
updated and it will not be tested at the same level of detail as for
official releases so no guarantee is provided for all ad-hoc
releases. All the builds will consist of stand alone branded version
for the Windows, Mac and Linux platforms.

This document start off with providing an overview of the release
numbering scheme in Section~\ref{sec:numbering}. This is followed by
Section~\ref{sec:Overture2010} which provides the current plan for the
releases of Overture executables during 2010. 
%Finally
%Section~\ref{sec:DESTECS2010} provides the current plan for the
%additional features released in the DESTECS executable releases in
%2010. Later on the document will be updated with plans for subsequent
%years. 

\chapter{Release Build Numbering}\label{sec:numbering}

The Overture project deliverables (both executables as
well as associated documentation) build numbering will be made with
the following format:
\begin{center}
\fbox{\textbf{X.Y.Z}}
\end{center}

The \textbf{X} indicates which is the major public release version of
the tool. 
%During the DESTECS project there will be three major
%releases of the DESTECS Tool (month 12, 24 and 36, i.e.\ December
%2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively). 
%It is suggested that these builds
%are numbered 1.0.0, 2.0.0 and 3.0.0 respectively.

An increase of \textbf{Y} indicates a minor public release including
significant update since last version, for example, a new feature
which have been through a proper release procedure. Thus the users can
expect it to be in a stable state.

An increase of  \textbf{Z} indicates an ad-hoc release with minor
update since the last version, for example, bug fixes. No guarantee for
stability is provided for these ad-hoc releases because they have not
been going through the release procedure used for public releases.

When release candidates are made available at the X and Y level there
shall be a list of checks that needs to be performed by different
named stakeholders before the
release candidate is lifted up to before an official X or Y
release. This check list shall include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item All examples for all dialects must be up to date with the
  software from the release.
\item The tutorials for all dialects must be updated to fit the newest
  screen dumps and the features in the new release.
\item Checks to be performed on the executable at each OS platform
  (Mac, Linux and Windows). The explicit list of what to check for the
  executables must be created.
\end{enumerate}
