To update *all* of the version numbers in the pom.xml files all at
once, use this command at the repository root:

$ find . -name "pom.xml" | xargs -n1 sed -i '' -e 's/2.0.0<!--Replaceable: Main Version-->/2.0.1<!--Replaceable: Main Version-->/'

Make sure you leave the "<!--Replaceable: Main Version-->" portion of
the string in place, otherwise this method will break and Joey will
come after you with sharp, pointy objects.

Also, the Bundle-Version field of the MANIFEST.MFs needs updating

$ find . -name MANIFEST.MF | xargs -n1 sed -i '' -e 's/^Bundle-Version: 2\.0\.0$/Bundle-Version: 2.0.1/'

Edit the main versions in the feature.xml files and
ide/product/overture.product, and check to make sure that version
numbers on the overture dependencies haven't crept in.

Check ide/product/category.xml to make sure that version numbers
haven't crept in.
