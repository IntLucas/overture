To update *all* of the version numbers in the pom.xml files all at
once, use this command at the repository root:

$ find . -name "pom.xml" | xargs -n1 sed -i '' -e 's/2.1.1<!--Replaceable: Main Version-->/2.1.2<!--Replaceable: Main Version-->/'

Replace 2.1.1 with the version that it's currently at, and replace
2.1.2 with the version you want it to be.

Make sure you leave the "<!--Replaceable: Main Version-->" portion of
the string in place, otherwise this method will break and Joey will
come after you with sharp, pointy objects.

Also, the Bundle-Version field of the MANIFEST.MFs needs updating

$ find . -name MANIFEST.MF | grep -v target | xargs -n1 emacsclient -n

[I'm not sure this is safe to sed yet]

And the feature.xml files...

Note: there is still some version number magic in the
ide/core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and ide/core/build.properties files, so
be sure to go through them and replace the version numbers
appropriately
