The Systems Modeling Language (SysML), is a Domain-Specific Modeling language for systems engineering. It supports the specification, analysis, design, verification and validation of a broad range of systems and systems-of-systems. SysML was originally developed by an open source specification project, and includes an open source license for distribution and use. SysML is defined as an extension of a subset of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) using UML's profile mechanism. \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_Modeling_Language}{wiki}

The AADL is a modeling language that supports early and repeated analyses of a system's architecture with respect to performance-critical properties through an extendable notation, a tool framework, and precisely defined semantics.

The language employs formal modeling concepts for the description and analysis of application system architectures in terms of distinct components and their interactions. It includes abstractions of software, computational hardware, and system components for (a) specifying and analyzing real-time embedded and high dependability systems, complex systems of systems, and specialized performance capability systems and (b) mapping of software onto computational hardware elements.

The AADL is especially effective for model-based analysis and specification of complex real-time embedded systems. This technical note is an introduction to the concepts, language structure, and application of the AADL

\section{Validation support}
\begin{description}
	\item[\textbf{Interpreter (with debug protocol)}] \textbf{VDMJ}. Enabling the execution of VDM models as in VDM Tools.

	\item[\textbf{Test generation support}] Combinatorial Testing \textbf{traces}

	\item[\textbf{Visualization for execution traces}] \textbf{ShowTrace}. Enabling a trace of execution to be visualized. If a VICE VDM model is traces all executions can be seen on the BUS'es and CPU's etc.

	\item[\textbf{Pretty Printing with coverage}] \fixme{Is this VDMJ and if so. What stage is it in. Think I remember that VDMJ can create the coverarge info so only the presentation is missing}
