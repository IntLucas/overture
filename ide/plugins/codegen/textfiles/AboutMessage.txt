The Java to VDM++ code generator indicates to the user if a construct
cannot be generated by highlighting it in the editor using a marker
(similar to the way warnings are shown) and outputs messages
about it in the console. Generated code is output in the generated/java
folder.

Code generation runtime:

The generated Java code depends on a runtime/library to represent VDM
collections, VDM types etc. The source code for the runtime can be found
in the Overture Github repository at:
